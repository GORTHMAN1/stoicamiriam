                    Since I was very young, I have been attracted to art itself, coloring everything I found, decorating things that maybe shouldn't have been decorated, singing anytime and at a quite loud volume, and impersonating famous characters or whoever appeared on TV. All these actions came instinctively, without premeditation or prior thought.

                    In 7th grade, I discovered an amateur theater course, where I felt very good, where I felt accepted, I felt like I belonged to that team. The people, the atmosphere, this sense of belonging made me love theater. And once contacted, it's very hard to detach yourself from it.

                <br>

                <p class="tab al-justify">
                    For me, theater and art, in general, mean a lot. I couldn't describe what I feel about art, try to define it or explain what it awakens in me, it's ineffable.
                </p>

                <p class="tab al-justify">
                    I believe that this thing called "art" <u>should not</u> necessarily be beautiful, aesthetic, pleasant, or easy to look at, quite the opposite. I'm not saying that art cannot be like that, of course it can, sometimes this form is more appreciated, but much more to my taste is the disgusting side of art, the grotesque, the slimy part of it. Not being able to look, being disturbed, awakening in me a desire to fight for the things presented to change.
                </p>

                <p class="tab al-justify">
                    I think the pandemic has been an efficient mentor for me, I once again realized the real importance of art and how society relates to it in such a context. It was sad, disappointing, and dry. Fortunately, there were virtual ways to spread art even in such moments. I believe that's when we needed it the most. Not just me, but people in general. 
                </p>

                <p class="tab al-justify">
                    Over time, I started to find it in everything and to try to create it from anything, and it, in turn, heals me, dresses wounds I didn't even know I had, helps me treat old afflictions that I thought were irreparable. It teaches me to be a better version of myself, and that's why I believe art must be ugly for us to be more beautiful.
                </p>

                <p class="tab al-justify">
                    I believe that at the core of art, just like at the core of the world, is love. And a very beautiful quote, found in the play "The Family M. Disease" directed by Radu Afrim, which I love and recommend on every occasion, says: "To live is beautiful, but to love is indispensable." So live, love, and consume as much art as possible. It's the only excess I know that has harmed no one.
